👋 Hello, I’m h4n13, a student from HCMUT (Ho Chi Minh University of Technology). I am beginning my journey in the world of computer science with a focus on cryptography. I aspire to become a blockchain developer because of my passion for cybersecurity and money (i mean crypto money🐧). Currently, I am a freshman in [BKISC](https://bkisc.com/) where i join in some CTF contests (i am a crypto CTF player).


I created this blog to share my write-ups, my journey, and my knowledge in the CS world, as well as some memorable moments from my life. I hope you find something useful and interesting here.
