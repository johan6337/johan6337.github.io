## I) Brief introduction about RSA ##

### Definition ###

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest and best-known asymmetric encryption schemes. The security of RSA relies on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem. In this blog post, we will discuss some attack that i collected from various sources.

### RSA encryption and decryption###

RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated the following way:

1. Choose two distinct prime numbers $p$ and $q$.
2. Compute $n = pq$.
3. Compute $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.
4. Choose an integer $e$ such that $1 < e < \phi(n)$ and $gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1$.
5. Compute $d$ such that $ed \equiv 1 \pmod{\phi(n)}$.
